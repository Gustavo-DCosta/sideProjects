I added the excel file using VsCode, well it gave it multiple errors
I passed a litle time readin the log, then I tried to open the file using Microsoft Excel, didn't worked 
It's need to create the xlsx file like with explorer and not VsCode

{ from openpyxl import Workbook

workbook = Workbook()

workbook.save(filename="sample.xlsx") }  CREATE A NEW SPREADSHEET

PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'C:\\Users\\veraf\\Desktop\\Python\\financesPy.xlsx'

THIS ERROR MEANS THAT THE FILE IS ACTIVE
